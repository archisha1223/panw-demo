# üí∏ Smart Financial Coach

This project is a personal finance web app that mimics the guidance of a real financial coach ‚Äî using AI to analyze your transactions and generate insights, forecasts, and warnings. It was built for the PANW case challenge.

### ‚ö° Features (3 MVPs)
1. **AI-Powered Spending Insights**:  
   Detects trends, anomalies, and spending patterns using Theil-Sen Regression, Isolation Forests, and heuristics.

2. **Personalized Goal Forecasting**:  
   Forecasts whether you‚Äôll meet a savings goal based on predicted spend (via per-category Linear Regression) and income.

3. **Subscriptions & Gray Charges Detector**:  
   Unsupervised-learning heuristics (based on cadence + variation) flag recurring charges, free trial conversions, and microtransactions.
